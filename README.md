# Matthew Langmuir Tutoring

A website I created with React for my online tutoring job. I used URL params to create the Course Materials page and used the EmailJS API for the Contact page, which my students use to ask me homework questions.

## Development

Run `yarn` and then `yarn start` to start development.

## Deployment

Autodeploy via Netlify. Hosted at https://tutoring.matthewlangmuir.com
